# githubtoipfs.com ⛓

## What is this?

githubtoipfs is a site to backup any public GitHub repo to IPFS, creating censorship resistant code 🤘

## Why did I build this?

after seeing the tornado cash github being removed, along with unrelated repos of contributors, it had given me a reminder of how much trust we put in such centralized services.

i have so many projects that aren't backed up, that can be removed at any point :(

## Demo!

## Usage 🤝

1. head to `githubtoipfs.com`
2. grab your `.zip` link from github by pressing `code` on the repo, and right-clicking `download .zip`
3. throw it in and we'll give ya an IPFS hash!
